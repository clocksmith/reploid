[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/doppler-gpu.svg?label=version)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/doppler-gpu)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/clocksmith/doppler/blob/main/LICENSE)

Run AI models locally in JavaScript: generate text, create embeddings, rerank
search results, and score bounded choices with WebGPU.
[Choice scoring](docs/api/choice-scoring.md) uses contextual single-token labels
and raw logits; it does not establish general judgment quality or calibration.

Available operations depend on the model and its qualified execution plan.
Applications own user experience, trust, and updates. Rig prepares the model;
Run executes its declared program. Browser and Node support are qualified
separately; Bun remains experimental.

**[Try Doppler in your browser](https://d4da.com/doppler/)** · [Get started](docs/getting-started.md)

Inspect example word choices immediately, or load a model to generate on your
device. Live inference needs a supported WebGPU browser and a model download.

## Start with the library

Use the [getting-started guide](docs/getting-started.md) for the obtainable,
version-pinned npm package and its hosted Gemma 3 270M model. That published
compatibility path is distinct from this checkout's newer public APIs and
unqualified source candidates. Host and model qualification remain scoped.

The [local-search starter](examples/document-search/README.md) is a retained,
versioned embedding/reranking example. Its 0.1.1 signed metadata permitted fresh
installation only before September 28, 2026, 00:55:40.930 UTC. Renewed metadata
and a new deliverable are needed before it becomes current fresh-install
onboarding. Existing [installed evidence](artifacts/document-search-maintenance-2026-09-26/README.md)
continues to describe its exact configurations; it does not extend that window.

## Mission, goal, and value

Make useful AI capabilities installable, inspectable, and maintainable as
application dependencies. Success means an independent application voluntarily
retains Doppler for a measured improvement and ships a second revision with less
release effort. Free adoption counts; benchmarks alone do not prove it.

Applications control trust and updates. This checkout introduces the breaking
[Capsule naming migration](docs/capsule-naming-migration.md); former Pack APIs
and schemas are not accepted. Capsule v2 and v3 are supported;
[Capsule v3](docs/capsule-identity-migration.md) separates executable identity from
release events. Doe, Poolday, and Reploid are optional, not prerequisites.

Build local generation, embeddings, reranking, or bounded choice scoring, or contribute improvements to
source interpretation, kernels, loading, and release reliability. See the
[goals](docs/goals.md) and [contribution guide](docs/contributing.md).

## How to use Doppler

Run the CLI without installing a global package:

```bash
npx --package doppler-gpu@0.6.1 doppler-gpu --model gemma3-270m --prompt "Summarize WebGPU in one sentence"
npx --package doppler-gpu@0.6.1 doppler-gpu --list-models
```

The live browser demo is at [d4da.com/doppler](https://d4da.com/doppler/).
The first documentation path is [getting started](https://github.com/clocksmith/doppler/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md),
followed by the [Doppler Run API](https://github.com/clocksmith/doppler/blob/main/docs/api/root.md).

For optional release operations, the installed command is `doppler release`; from
npm use `npx --package doppler-gpu doppler release`. It consumes a pinned
`production-release/v1` manifest and signed exact-device receipts, then emits an
`eligible` or `blocked` decision and retained evidence. It never activates or
deploys the customer application. See the [release platform contract](docs/model-release-platform.md)
and [CLI reference](docs/cli.md).

### Doppler Run API

This example describes the checkout API. Confirm exports and operation
qualification in the exact package you install; npm 0.6.1 does not contain newer
choice-scoring or partition exports.

```js
import { openCapsule } from 'doppler-gpu/host';
import { reviewedRelease } from './reviewed-release.js';

const session = await openCapsule(reviewedRelease.capsuleUrl, {
  trustedSigners: reviewedRelease.trustedSigners,
  acceptedTargetPlanDigests: reviewedRelease.acceptedTargetPlanDigests,
});
try {
  const result = await session.rerank({
    application: reviewedRelease.application,
    query: 'Which API provides browser GPU compute?',
    documents: ['WebGPU exposes GPU compute.', 'WebSocket transports messages.'],
    options: {},
  });
  console.log(result, session.selectedTargetPlanDigest);
} finally {
  await session.close();
}
```

`reviewedRelease` is application-owned configuration, not metadata trusted merely
because it was downloaded. It identifies a reranker Capsule, accepted plans, trusted
publishers, and the application/workload/oracle contract. The host entry composes
the existing device, artifact-store, and program ports; trust and upgrades remain
explicit. See the [Electron integration](examples/electron-document-search/README.md)
and [retained evaluation](docs/integration/reranker-evaluation.md).

Advanced applications can still inject every port through `doppler-gpu` or
`doppler-gpu/run`. Both routes verify the same Capsule and initial execution
identity. The host facade does not add model operations or broaden qualification.

Discover repository commands with `npm run` or `npm pkg get scripts` (JSON).
Use `doppler --help` for the installed CLI.

The former manifest-loading facade remains available only as an explicit
compatibility import:

```js
import { dr } from 'doppler-gpu/compat';

const session = await dr.open('qwen3-0.8b');
const result = await session.generate('Describe WebGPU briefly');
await session.close();
```

### OpenAI-compatible server

```bash
npx doppler-serve --model qwen3-0.8b --port 8080
```

The server accepts requests at `http://localhost:8080/v1`. Registry IDs resolve
to hosted RDRR artifacts from `clocksmith/rdrr` by default.

### LoRA loading and training

```bash
npx doppler-gpu lora --config ./workload.json --surface node
```

Doppler supports SafeTensors LoRA loading and hot swap at runtime. SFT/LoRA
training is available through the experimental Node, Bun, and browser training
surface. Cataloged adapter identities and lifecycle states are listed in
[`models/adapters/catalog.json`](models/adapters/catalog.json). See the
[LoRA format](docs/lora-format.md), [training handbook](docs/training-handbook.md),
and [Training API](docs/api/training.md).

## Technical architecture

The component view follows source at `f38d95e8`. These diagrams show the standalone
runtime and its partition boundary, not new model or hardware qualification. See the
[architecture guide](docs/architecture.md#technical-diagrams) for source owners and details.

### Preparation, host, and execution ownership

Opening a model joins a declared program with verified artifacts and an accepted
GPU implementation. Repeated operations reuse loaded weights while their mutable
state has a separate lifetime. Arrows show construction, calls, and data moving
between the owners; returned results make the execution loop explicit.

![Ten Doppler components show signed model preparation, runtime verification, artifact loading, resident state, operation sessions, and the GPU submission and result loop.](assets/readme/technical-architecture.svg)

[Open the diagram at full size](assets/readme/technical-architecture.svg).

A normal Capsule session leases one operation at a time. Cancellation and close
await settlement; they cannot interrupt already submitted GPU work. Supported
resident partitions expose the same model computation to an external coordinator.
Peer discovery and placement remain outside Doppler; Doe is an optional provider.

### Resident partitions and resource lifetime

Resident weights and attempt state have distinct lifetimes. The manifest factory
is an explicit integration path, not a signed Capsule qualification claim.

## Supported RDRR model types

Doppler classifies artifacts by what they consume and produce. This is
separate from lineage (`family`), runtime implementation (`modelType`), and
artifact-size tier.

| Type | Input → output | Runtime-verified / cataloged | Representative lanes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text generators | text → text | 13 / 17 | gemma-3-1b-it-q4k-ehf16-af32<br>gemma-3-270m-it-f16-af32<br>gemma-3-270m-it-q4k-ehf16-af32<br>+14 more |

The [full model-support matrix](https://github.com/clocksmith/doppler/blob/main/docs/model-support-matrix.md)
lists every lane and its lifecycle evidence. Classification says what an
artifact is shaped to do; only lifecycle receipts establish what is
verified, and a runtime pass does not by itself qualify every declared input
modality.

## Evidence

Doppler has accepted browser WebGPU comparisons with higher steady-state inference throughput
(higher is faster) than Transformers.js where the declared workload correctness and
throughput gates pass. Loading is a separate measurement; the referenced
Vulkan embedding and reranker artifacts load faster in Transformers.js. The
[scoreboard](https://github.com/clocksmith/doppler/blob/main/docs/model-competition-scoreboard.md)
links the receipts and the [benchmark methodology](https://github.com/clocksmith/doppler/blob/main/docs/benchmark-methodology.md)
defines the gates.

## Architecture and releases

Rig prepares and qualifies signed model implementations; Run verifies and
executes them. Applications own trust, upgrades, and search policy. See the
[architecture](docs/architecture.md) and [release contract](docs/model-release-platform.md)
for the engineering workflow and model-family requirements.

## Limits and current status

WebGPU is required. Use a current Chromium browser; Node installs the WebGPU
provider as an optional dependency. A runtime pass does not verify every input
modality, and a receipt records what ran without establishing output quality.
Throughput comparisons are valid only when the workload, timing scope, and
correctness path are comparable. Unsupported paths fail closed.
