# Blueprint 0x00005C: VFS Version Control Tools Manifest

**Objective:** Documents the VFS version control tools manifest that provides git-like operations for the virtual file system.

**Target Upgrade:** VFS Tools (`tools-vcs.json`)

**Prerequisites:** None (Tool manifest)

**Affected Artifacts:** `/upgrades/tools-vcs.json`

---

### 1. The Strategic Imperative

The agent needs version control tools to track changes to artifacts in the Virtual File System. The `tools-vcs.json` manifest defines git-like tools for viewing history, comparing versions, and reverting changes.

### 2. The Architectural Solution

The `/upgrades/tools-vcs.json` artifact is a JSON file containing an array of VFS version control tool definitions:

- **`vfs_log`**: Returns the commit history for a VFS file
- **`vfs_diff`**: Returns the diff between two versions of a file
- **`vfs_revert`**: Reverts a file to a previous state (destructive operation)

### 3. Tool Definitions

Each tool in the manifest includes:
- `name`: The tool's identifier
- `description`: Human-readable description of what the tool does
- `parameters`: JSON Schema describing the tool's input parameters

### 4. Integration

These tools are loaded by the tool runner and made available to the agent's cognitive cycle. They enable the agent to track its own evolution and revert problematic changes.
