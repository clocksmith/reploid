# DOPPLER Vision & Roadmap

**Why DOPPLER exists:** Browser-native, dynamic LLM inference that can't be achieved with pre-compiled approaches like TVM/WebLLM.

## The Capability Thesis

The industry is fixated on a false dichotomy: **privacy vs. performance**. That is boring.

Reploid's value proposition is **Capability**. We are building the only architecture capable of running a 600B+ parameter model on a MacBook Air without lobotomizing the weights.

We achieve this by inverting the standard stack. Instead of bringing the data to a centralized model, we mount a **Distributed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** directly to the browser runtime via DOPPLER. The P2P mesh becomes an infinite-capacity cache tier for model weights.

**What we're building:**

- **Infrastructure:** A 600B+ parameter MoE mounted over P2P WebRTC mesh
- **Intelligence:** Hierarchical routers that stream specialized expert clusters on demand
- **Evolution:** LoRA adapters distributed as delta shards that upgrade model capabilities

We trade bandwidth (which is cheap) for intelligence (which is expensive). This delivers datacenter-grade capability on consumer-grade hardware. The big players can't pivot because their valuation depends on renting H100s.

## The Scale Math

A frontier-class model (e.g., DeepSeek-V3, 671B parameters) is not a monolithic binary. It is a file system of thousands of granular expert shards.

**RDRR Sharding Strategy:**
- Model sliced into ~9,600 **Expert Shards** (64MB each)
- 64MB optimized for WebRTC `RTCDataChannel` throughput
- Aligns with browser OPFS block allocation

**Content Addressing:**
- Request `SHA256(shard_bytes)`, not "Health Expert v1"
- Instant integrity verification
- P2P mesh acts as infinite-capacity L4 cache

**The Mount:**
- Reploid downloads a **Manifest** (~150KB), not the model
- Weights stay on the network until called
- MoE sparsity: only ~25% of experts active per token

**Tiered Storage:**

| Tier | Capacity | Latency | Contents |
|------|----------|---------|----------|
| GPU VRAM | 8-24GB | <1ms | Active experts, KV cache |
| Unified RAM | 32-128GB | ~5ms | Warm experts, session state |
| OPFS | 10-50GB | ~50ms | Cold experts, cached shards |
| P2P Swarm | Unlimited | ~200ms | Rare experts, full model |

See [PHASE_3_SCALE.md](roadmap/PHASE_3_SCALE.md) for detailed tiered memory architecture.

**Result:** 600B model on consumer hardware.

## Architectural Bets

DOPPLER makes five interlocking bets that diverge from the WebLLM/TVM approach:

### Bet 1: Code/Data Separation

| Layer | WebLLM | DOPPLER |
|-------|--------|---------|
| GPU kernels | WGSL (TVM-generated, model-specific) | WGSL (generic, shared across models) |
| Orchestration | WASM (compiled C++) | JavaScript |
| Weights | Bundled with compiled binary | Just data (64MB shards) |

WebLLM compiles each model into a `.wasm` bundle containing TVM-generated WGSL shaders + WASM orchestration code. The model is a **monolithic unit**.

DOPPLER treats kernels as **generic data processors**. The same `matmul.wgsl` processes any weight matrix. Models are just **manifest + weight shards**.

> "MLC-LLM takes in any open-source model's implementation in Python... and compiles the model's computation into the backend of interest (WebGPU). The WASM library contains both compute kernels in WGSL and non-kernel functions in WebAssembly."
>

### Bet 2: GPU Fusion Eliminates CPU Bottleneck

If 99% of compute is on GPU, optimizing the 1% CPU layer is pointless.

```
WebLLM decode step:        DOPPLER decode step:
├─ WASM tokenize           ├─ JS: bind buffers
├─ WASM layer loop         ├─ JS: queue.submit()
├─ WASM attention logic    ├─ GPU: fused attention
├─ WASM sampling           ├─ GPU: fused MoE routing
└─ ~2-3x faster CPU ops    ├─ JS: read logits (0.5ms)
                           └─ JS: sample token

CPU time: significant      CPU time: ~0.5ms (negligible)
```

**DOPPLER's MoE routing is GPU-native**: Router → softmax+topk → scatter_add all stay on GPU with zero CPU readback. See [gpu/kernels/topk.wgsl](../gpu/kernels/topk.wgsl).

### Bet 3: JavaScript is Fast Enough

Modern JS engines (V8, SpiderMonkey, JSC) are extraordinarily optimized:
- JIT compilation approaches native speed for hot paths
- TypedArrays enable zero-copy GPU upload
- Async/await enables non-blocking GPU dispatch

For thin orchestration (dispatch commands, sample one token), JS overhead is ~0.5ms per decode step. This is **2%** of a 26ms decode cycle.

### Bet 4: Readback is the Real Enemy

Every GPU→CPU transfer costs 2-6ms (wait + copy + map), 10-60x the actual compute time.

| Operation | DOPPLER | Readback? |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Attention scores | Fused in `attention.wgsl` | No |
| MoE routing | Fused in `softmax_topk.wgsl` | No |
| KV cache update | GPU buffer writes | No |
| Intermediate activations | Stay on GPU | No |
| Final logits | Read for sampling | **Yes (unavoidable)** |

DOPPLER's architecture ensures only ONE readback per token: the final logits for sampling.

### Bet 5: Flexibility Enables Impossible Capabilities

| Capability | Requires | WebLLM | DOPPLER |
|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| 90GB MoE on 8GB VRAM | Expert paging | **No** | **Yes** |
| P2P kernel evolution | Plain-text WGSL | **No** | **Yes** |
| LoRA without recompile | Generic kernels | **No** | **Yes** |
| Device-specific optimization | Runtime kernel swap | **No** | **Yes** |
| Speculative decoding | Multi-model coordination | Awkward | **Native** |

## Why Not TVM? (Detailed)

WebLLM uses Apache TVM to pre-compile model-specific WGSL kernels with auto-tuning:

| Aspect | TVM/WebLLM | DOPPLER |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Kernel performance | ~80% native (auto-tuned) | ~60-70% native (manual) |
| New model support | Requires offline compilation | Runtime-compatible |
| Dynamic sharding | Not possible (fixed in binary) | Load/unload experts freely |
| P2P distribution | Distribute compiled .wasm | Distribute weight shards only |
| Model evolution | Recompile entire model | Swap shards, keep kernels |
| LoRA adapters | Recompile with LoRA fused | Hot-swap at runtime |
| Browser-only operation | Needs compilation toolchain | Fully in-browser |

> "Evaluations show that WebLLM can retain up to 80% native performance on the same device."
>
> Source: [WebLLM Paper (arXiv:2412.15803)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15803)

**DOPPLER accepts ~20% kernel performance gap** because:
1. Large MoE models can't fit in VRAM anyway (paging required)
2. P2P distribution requires code/data separation
3. Runtime flexibility enables speculative decoding, LoRA, expert paging
4. These capabilities are **impossible** with pre-compiled approaches

---

## Concrete Capability Examples

### Expert Paging (MoE)

Mixtral 8x7B: 8 experts × ~3GB each = 24GB. Only 2 active per token.

```
WebLLM: All 8 experts compiled into binary
        └─ Must fit all 24GB in VRAM or fail

DOPPLER: Generic FFN kernel + weight buffer binding
        ├─ Load expert_2 from OPFS → bind → run kernel
        ├─ Evict expert_2 (release buffer)
        ├─ Load expert_7 from peer → bind → same kernel
        └─ Run 90GB model on 8GB VRAM via paging
```

### P2P Evolution (Dynamic Components)

The real P2P value is **evolving dynamic components**, not distributing static weights:

```
WebLLM: Kernels frozen in compiled binary
        └─ Everyone uses same TVM-generated kernels forever

DOPPLER: Kernels are plain text, evolve across swarm
        ├─ User discovers 2x faster attention on M3 Max
        ├─ Shares kernel hash → peers benchmark → confirm
        ├─ Best kernels propagate by device class
        └─ Also: LoRA adapters, sampling strategies, router weights
```

**Static weights** → CDN (HuggingFace). **Dynamic components** → P2P evolution.

See [COMPETITIVE.md](analysis/COMPETITIVE.md#p2p-and-evolution-potential) for detailed analysis.

### Speculative Decoding

```
WebLLM: Draft model = separate compiled binary
        Target model = separate compiled binary
        └─ Coordinating two compiled models is awkward

DOPPLER: Draft model = small model weights
        Target model = large model weights
        ├─ Same kernels for both
        ├─ Share KV cache buffers
        └─ JS coordinates verification (flexible, debuggable)
```
