# REPLOID Knowledge Base

**[Back to Harness README](../README.md)**

---

> **Architecture Note:** Blueprints form the knowledge foundation for REPLOID's Guardian Agent capabilities. They are technical specifications bundled into user-facing **Personas** defined in `config.json`. This directory contains the architectural patterns and implementation guides that enable the agent's self-improvement and evolution. See `docs/PERSONAS.md` for persona development details.

This directory contains REPLOID's conceptual knowledge base. The files herein are instructional markdown documents, or **"blueprints,"** designed to be discovered and studied by the agent itself. Each blueprint provides a high-level guide to potential self-improvements, outlining architectural principles, strategic goals, and implementation pathways for major capabilities.

The knowledge base serves as a catalyst for the agent's Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) cycles. These blueprints provide structured, expert-level knowledge that accelerates development through the Guardian Agent's human-in-the-loop approval flow.

## Blueprint Style Guide

### 1. Philosophy

This guide ensures every blueprint in the REPLOID knowledge base is consistent, machine-readable, and pedagogically sound. Blueprints are the agent's textbooks; their structure and clarity are paramount for facilitating autonomous learning and evolution. Adherence to this guide is mandatory for all new blueprint artifacts.

### 2. File Naming Convention

Blueprint files MUST follow a strict naming convention:

`0x{HEX_ID}-{kebab-case-title}.md`

-   `0x{HEX_ID}`: A zero-padded, 6-digit hexadecimal identifier (e.g., `0x000001`, `0x00000A`, `0x000012`).
-   `kebab-case-title`: A short, descriptive title in lowercase, with words separated by hyphens.

**Example:** `0x000008-agent-cognitive-cycle.md`

### 3. Core Blueprint Structure

Every blueprint artifact MUST contain the following sections, in this precise order, using the specified Markdown formatting.

```
# Blueprint 0x{HEX_ID}: [Title Case Title]

**Objective:** A single, concise sentence articulating the primary goal or purpose of the concept described in this blueprint.

**Prerequisites:** A list of other blueprint IDs that should be understood before tackling this one. Use "None" if it is a foundational concept.
- *Example: `Prerequisites: 0x000004, 0x000005`*

**Affected Artifacts:** A list of the primary VFS artifacts that will likely be created, modified, or deleted if the agent acts on this blueprint.
- *Example: `/modules/agent-cycle.js`, `/modules/prompt-system.md`*

---

### 1. The Strategic Imperative
*(This section explains the "Why." It provides the high-level strategic reasoning behind the concept. It should be focused and concise, ideally between 50-150 words).*

### 2. The Architectural Solution
*(This section explains the "How." It describes the technical design and architectural pattern that solves the strategic challenge. It may include small code snippets using Markdown code fences to illustrate key ideas).*

### 3. The Implementation Pathway
*(This section provides the "What." It is a clear, step-by-step list of actions the agent could take to implement the solution. This serves as a guide for the agent's own planning process).*
```

### 4. Content and Formatting Rules

-   **Headings:** Use a single H1 for the title and H3 for the three core sections.
-   **Keywords:** Use `**bold**` for critical terms, file paths, and artifact IDs.
-   **Code:** Use `backticks` for inline code and fenced code blocks (e.g., ````javascript`) for multi-line examples.
-   **Tone:** The language MUST be objective, technical, and pedagogical. The blueprint is a formal technical document.
-   **Conciseness:** Each section should be focused and to the point. The goal is clarity and efficient machine-parsing by the agent.
