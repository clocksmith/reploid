# REPLOID Persona Architecture

This directory contains the definitions for REPLOID's modular cognitive personas:

- **`sys_prompt_x.txt`**: Defines **X**, The Fabricator, focused on building robust and elegant solutions.
- **`sys_prompt_y.txt`**: Defines **Y**, The Visionary, focused on strategy, context, and ethics.
- **`sys_prompt_z.txt`**: Defines **Z**, The Auditor, focused on scrutinizing for flaws and ensuring correctness.

These files provide a blueprint for a structured, triad-based cognitive model. While the system can adopt these personas for its core prompt, their full interactive potential is a key area for future development.
